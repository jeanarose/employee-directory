## Description
[Employee Directory](https://jeanarose.github.io/employee-directory/) is a React application designed to display employee data such as name, phone, email, date of birth, and a profile picture. Users can search for users by first name or sort by name, email, or DOB. Employee Directory is a useful application for collecting contact information in a simple and efficient way. Rather than emailing several coworkers to find an employee's contact information, a user can simply use Employee Directory instead.

This application took advantage of the following technologies:
* React functional components, class components, JSX expressions, state, and props
* Random User API
* Bulma
